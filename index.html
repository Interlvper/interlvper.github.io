							<p class="text-left">
								Video games have always been a central part of my life. This led me to pursue game development as soon as 
								I realized that it was within my reach. Since then, I’ve gained hands-on experience with multiple game engines, 
								including Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								I earned my programming degree in 2017. This degree deepened my proficiency in programming languages such as Java, Python,
								and C++. This academic foundation help expand my understanding of software engineering beyond game-specific applications.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in procedural generation and data-driven design. I’m drawn to these areas 
								because they offer rich opportunities for creative expression while presenting complex technical challenges that 
								continually push me to grow as a programmer.

								Interests
							</h3>

							<p class="text-left">
								- My favorite game genres are first-person shooters, dungeon crawlers, and hardcore survival games.
								<br/>
								- Simple mechanics that allow skill expression from the player are my favorite.
								<br/>
								- My most played game is Counter-Strike. When I played competitively, I reached the top 100 players in North America and helped bring my team into the top 50 teams in the region.
								<br/>
								- Other than gaming, music is a passion of mine and I have worked as a songwriter/producer. I also have played guitar for 14 years.
								<br/>
								- My favorite game of all time is Kenshi. I find the brutal, hardcore, and open world nature of the game incredibly appealing and rewarding.

									This my game engine of choice as I am most familiar with it. I am well versed in its Systems

									Game Programming
								</h3>

								<p class="text-left">
									I have produced a variety of gameplay systems for clients, the Unreal Engine Marketplace (now FAB), and my own personal use.
									These systems include AI Pathfinders, Inventory Systems, Health Systems, Procedural Systems (Terrain, Levels, Weapons, etc),
									Interaction Systems, Projectile Systems, Editor Tools, and much more.

							<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-11">
								<h3 class="text-left">
									C++
								</h3>

								<p class="text-left">
									This is my favorite programming language. I have used it for Unreal Engine, personal projects, school, and desktop applications. 
									I find the language to be highly expressive and it allows me to optimize my code to a level that I cannot reach in other languages.
