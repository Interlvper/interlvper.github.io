					<p class="text-left">
						Video games are a core aspect of my life. Because of this, I started with game development as soon as I realized that
						it was something that I could do. Since then, I have worked with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot to name a few.<br/>
						<br/>
						I went to college for a software development degree and furthered my knowledge of the programming languages Java,
						Python, and C++. This experience helped me develop an understanding of programming outside just video games.<br/>
						<br/>
						As my time as a game programmer has progressed, I have found that I have a particular interest in procedural generation
						and data-driven design approaches as they feel like they allow the most diversity and introduce a lot of challenging
						problems that I feel test me as a programmer.
					</p>

						Interests
					</h3>

					<p class="text-left">
						- First-person shooters, dungeon crawlers, and hardcore survival games are my favorite to play by myself and with friends.<br/>
						- I am a big fan of simple mechanics that allow for complex decision-making from the player.<br/>
						- I have reached the top 100 players in North America for CS2 and helped bring my team to the top 50.<br/>
						- Other than gaming, music is a passion of mine and I have worked as a songwriter/producer. I also have played guitar for 14 years.<br/>
						- My favorite game of all time is undoubtedly Kenshi. I find the brutal, hardcore nature of the game incredibly appealing and rewarding.<br/>

							Unreal Engine
						</h3>

						<p class="text-left">
							This my game engine of choice that I am most familiar with. I worked with the majority of the systems
							in Unreal at least once and have worked extensively in both C++ and Blueprints. It has been a massive help
							to my learning as all the source code is available to read.

					<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-11">
						<h3 class="text-left">
							Game Programming
						</h3>

						<p class="text-left">
							I have produced a variety of gameplay systems for clients, the Unreal Engine Marketplace, and my own personal use.
							These systems include AI Pathfinders, Inventory Systems, Health Systems, Procedural Systems (Terrain, Levels, Weapons, etc),
							Interaction Systems, and Editor Tools.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-11">
						<h3 class="text-left">
							C++
						</h3>

						<p class="text-left">
							This is not only my favorite programming language, but the one that I started with. I have used it for Unreal Engine,
							personal projects, school, and desktop application development. I find the language to be highly expressive and it allows
							me to optimize to a level I feel that I cannot reach in other languages.
